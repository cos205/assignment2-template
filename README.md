# Project 2

## Available materials

```/tools```

This directory includes all the simulators and tools for this project.

```/src```
This directory includes all the files required to complete this project.

```/grader```
Do not modify this repository. It is necessary for running the github grading scripts.

When you push a change to github, an autograder script will be triggered. You will see a commit from the autograding workflow.
When the workflow is complete (it may take a few seconds) you will see a grade assigned to the commit based on whether the chips passed our tests.
The output will look similar to the one you see when you run test scripts locally using the simulator.

The autograding workflow will have some additional output to help you debug- but please learn how to test your chips locally and do not rely solely on
the autograder.

## Collaboration

You may work on this assignment in teams of two, or individually.
